Purpose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to take in a set numbers of digits from a array and
then reverse them. I beleive this will not only help me understand SIC/XE but the logice use
for the actual functionality of the of the the SIC/XE instructions. I choses to implenenemt 
the project in SIC/XE, so i could use a better case of the registers. I read in the testfile
forward then stored it backwards in a new array. There is also the area that makes people 
understand the addressing in the files as well as the indexing. The testfile I am using will 
only have ten character since the read device only READS BYTE by BYTE. However, that will 
then be converted into asci Base_10 then which is then convert to hex that I will store
into the Array. I must make sure I change the index by three for I am storing the word which is

Source Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will list the files and then their explanations
{pgm, pgm.obj,pgm.lst,testfile,Log_updated.docx,sic.log}
"pgm"-source file for the code that is to be assembled in the from "sicasm" command
"pgm.obj"- object file that holds the object code for sicsim
"pgm.lst"- gives the {address,label,instruction,operand,comments} format from the source file
	   that was assembled through sicasm making it easier to read the source file
"testfile"-this is the test data of 10 digits since the Read Device reads everything BYTE by
	   BYTE
"Log_updated.docx"- this has my sic dump with highlight keys and explanation
"sic.log"-a log file to show the commands and sic dump i printed to my console
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contents of "testfile"
----------------------
0123456789

Output Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refer to the Console for the Output of the dump

Execuation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theses are the commands you will need to run in order to successful run the program
The files you should be using is 
	Step 0: unshar Project2
	Step 1: sicasm pgm
		-The typical approved window of it works should pop up
	Step 2: sicsim 
	Step 3: press “r” 
		-To rename the files
	Step 4: press Enter 
	Step 5: we rename DEVF1 to “pgm.obj” by typing "pgm.obj"
		press "Enter"
		Then rename DEVF2 to “testfile” by typing "testfile"
	Step 6: press “enter” until the options windows of “a” or “r” pops up
	Step 7:	Press  “a” to accept
	Step 8: Press “s” to start
	Step 9: press “r” to run until “Unsupported Machine Instruction Reached” comes
	Step 10: then type “d 100-200”

After that you will see the same type of contents for the values for the Log_updated.docx
on location address 149 and forward
